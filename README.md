# airbnb-nyc-analysis

Excel and PowerBI analysis and visualization on Airbnb in New York City. We were prompted to compare leasing a 2-bedroom NYC apartment or renting it out on Airbnb. We hypothesized that if we compared the prices from renting through AirBnb to that of a standard
leasing option, leasing would be the more profitable venture for our client.
